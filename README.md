# HandWrittern-digit-Classification
Using Artificial Neural Network created handwritten classification, used mnist dataset from keras, also used Tensorflow for confusion matrix and load the keras. Evalute model with test dataset and got 98 % of accuracy. Confusion mtrix shows the how many wrong numbers selected as a right in which I used heatmap from seaborn library.
